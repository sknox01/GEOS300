1. Use the web applet on modelled extraterrestrial irradiance (http://www.geog.ubc.ca/courses/geob300/applets/latitude/) to answer the following questions: 

(a) At what latitude do we expect the highest yearly total KEx? What is the consequence of this on global circulation?

(b) At what latitude do we expect the maximum daily total KEx? How can we explain this? 

(c) For Vancouver BC, when do you expect the highest KEx, and when the lowest? 


```{r}
# Enter Answers here  
```

2. If at λ = 600 nm the spectral absorptivity of a completely opaque object is equal ζλ = 0.75, what is its spectral reflectivity αλ?


```{r}
# if Ψλ + αλ + ζλ = 1, where Ψλ is psi, αλ is alpha, and ζλ is zeta

zeta <- 0.75
psi <-  # Enter the value for psi here

alpha <-  # Rearranage the equation above to solve for apha 

# Display output
cat("The spectral reflectivity is: ", alpha)
```

3. In the the PAR range, a green leaf shows a reflectivity of  αPAR = 0.11 and a transmissivity ΨPAR = 0.08 (assume constant values across the PAR range). If incident PPFD on the leaf is 800 μmol s-1 m-1, calculate the absorbed PPFD.


```{r}
# Define known values
alpha <- 0.11
psi <- 0.08

# Calculate absorptivity (zeta)
zeta  <- 

# Calculate absorbed PPFD
PPFDin <- 800 # Incident PPDF (umol m-1 s-1)
PPFDabs <- 

# Display output
cat("The the absorbed PPFD: ", PPFDabs, "umol m-2 s-1")
```

4. Calculate the bulk Atmospheric Transmissivity Ψa for Port Hardy, BC on Vancouver Island, at 14:00 on February 15th if a pyranometer measures K↓ = 298 W m-2.


```{r}
# First define known variables
Kdown <- 298 

# Next calculate cosZ (or sin β - the two are equal) - see Study Questions for Lecture 4
library(hms)

LST <- as_hms("14:00:00")

# define the standard meridian for Port Hardy
Standard_meridian <- 

# Define the longitude
long <- 

# Define the difference between Port Hardy's longitude and the standard meridian
delta_long  <- 

# Calculate LMST for both days
LMST <- LST+hms(0,delta_long*4,0) # Note no need to include DST (daylight savings time)

# This is needed to output LMST in {r}'s time format
LMST <- hms(as.numeric(LMST))

# Define DOY
DOY <- 46
gamma <- # Calculate gamma

# Next the time offset between LMST and LAT (∆TLAT, i.e. deltaT_LAT), in minutes can be calculated using the formula given in Lecture 4, Slide 12
deltaT_LAT <- 

# Convert to {r} time format 
deltaT_LAT <- hms(seconds = NULL, minutes = deltaT_LAT, hours = NULL, days = NULL)

# Hence, LAT = LMST − ∆TLAT
LAT <- LMST - hms(as.numeric(deltaT_LAT))

# This is needed to output LAT in {r}'s time format
LAT <- hms(as.numeric(LAT))

# Now we can calculate the declination angle using the more precise formulation
delta2 <- 

# Note that delta2 is in radians - we need to convert radians to degrees
delta2deg <- 

# Define latitude. Note that here we use a vector to be able to calculate the solar altitude angle for both days
latitude <- 50.72

# Next we can calculate the hour angle (h = 15◦(12 − LAT)) using LAT estimated above. 
# Note LAT is the local apparent time (see above) in hours of the day (with minutes as a fraction of an hour). This can be calculated using the following:
LAT2 <- as.numeric(LAT)/60/60 # This converts hh:mm:ss to hour of the day

# Now calculate h
h <- round(15*(12-LAT2)) # Round the hour angle to the nearest degree using round()

# Now we can calculate the solar altitude angle
# First calculate sin β - note that we have to convert angles in degrees to radians (multiply degrees by (pi/180))
sinbeta <- 

# Next calculate β (*(180/pi) to convert radians to degrees)
beta <- 

# Display output
cat("For February 15 β is: ", round(beta,2), intToUtf8(176), "\n") # β is rounded to 2 decimal points (using round() function)

# Define cosZ
cosZ <- sinbeta 

# Calculate m
m <- 
cat("m is equal to: ", round(m,3), "\n")

# Next Calculate the extraterrestrial short-wave irradiance KEx as done in Study Questions for Lecture 4
# Define the solar constant (I0):
Io  <- 1366.5 # units of W m−2

# Account for the non-circular orbit (changing distance over course of a year) (note gamma is calculated above)
ratio2 <- 

# Calculate KEx (note that sinbeta is estimated above)
KEx <- 

cat("For February 15 at 14:00 KEx is: ", round(KEx), "W/m2", "\n")

# Finally we can calculate psia:
psia  <-  

# Display output
cat("For February 15 at 14:00 psia is: ", round(psia,2), "\n")
```

5. Assume that transmissivity Ψa does not change over that day, and calculate K↓ for 10:00 (same location, same day).


```{r}
# The calculation will be similar to that above, except the time is now 10:00 am
LST <- as_hms("10:00:00")

# define the standard meridian for Port Hardy
Standard_meridian <- -120

# Define the longitude
long <- -127.5

# Define the difference between Port Hardy's longitude and the standard meridian
delta_long  <- 

# Calculate LMST for both days
LMST <- 

# This is needed to output LMST in R's time format
LMST <- 

# Define DOY
DOY <- 46
gamma <- # Calculate gamma

# Next the time offset between LMST and LAT (∆TLAT, i.e. deltaT_LAT), in minutes can be calculated using the formula given in Lecture 4, Slide 12
deltaT_LAT <- 

# Convert to R time format 
deltaT_LAT <- 

# Hence, LAT = LMST − ∆TLAT
LAT <- 

# This is needed to output LAT in R's time format
LAT <- 

# Now we can calculate the declination angle using the more precise formulation
delta2 <- 

# Note that delta2 is in radians - we need to convert radians to degrees
delta2deg <- 

# Define latitude. Note that here we use a vector to be able to calculate the solar altitude angle for both days
latitude <- 

# Next we can calculate the hour angle (h = 15◦(12 − LAT)) using LAT estimated above. 
# Note LAT is the local apparent time (see above) in hours of the day (with minutes as a fraction of an hour). This can be calculated using the following:
LAT2 <- 

# Now calculate h
h <- 

# Now we can calculate the solar altitude angle
# First calculate sin β - note that we have to convert angles in degrees to radians (multiply degrees by (pi/180))
sinbeta <- 

# Next calculate β (*(180/pi) to convert radians to degrees)
beta <- 

# Display output
cat("For February 15 at 10:00 β is: ", round(beta,2), intToUtf8(176), "\n") # β is rounded to 2 decimal points (using round() function)

# Define cosZ
cosZ <- 

# Calculate m
m <- 
cat("m is equal to: ", round(m,3), "\n")

# Next Calculate the extraterrestrial short-wave irradiance KEx as done in Study Questions for Lecture 4
# Define the solar constant (I0):
Io  <- # units of W m−2

# Account for the non-circular orbit (changing distance over course of a year) (note gamma is calculated above)
ratio2 <- 

# Calculate KEx (note that sinbeta is estimated above)
KEx <- 

cat("For February 15 at 10:00 KEx is: ", round(KEx), "W/m2", "\n")

# Now we can calculate Kdown (with psia the same as above in Q4)
Kdown <- 
cat("For February 15 at 10:00 Kdown is: ", round(Kdown), "W/m2", "\n")
```
